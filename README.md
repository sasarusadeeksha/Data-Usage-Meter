# Data Usage Meter

**Data Usage Meter** is a lightweight Windows desktop application that helps you monitor and control your daily internet usage in real time. It is designed for users who want accurate data tracking, clear limits, and a clean, modern interface without unnecessary complexity.

The app runs quietly in the background, tracks usage per Wi-Fi network, shows live network speed, and notifies you when usage limits are reached.
